## Introduction

Clustering is important in business because it allows businesses to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior, which can help them make more informed decisions and improve their marketing strategies. By grouping customers into distinct clusters based on their spending behavior, businesses can tailor their marketing messages and promotions to specific customer groups, increasing the effectiveness of their marketing efforts. Additionally, clustering analysis can help businesses identify areas for improvement in their products or services, such as identifying which features are most important to specific customer groups. Overall, analyzing clustering is an important tool for businesses to gain insights into their customer behavior and improve their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of their customers. 

Analyzing the clustering of tenure of credit card service for users is important for businesses because it can provide insights into the loyalty and retention of customers. By understanding the patterns and behaviors of customers who have held credit cards for longer periods of time, businesses can tailor their products and services to meet their needs and preferences. For example, if customers who have held credit cards for a longer period of time tend to make more purchases in installments, a business could offer installment payment plans or promotions to incentivize this behavior and retain these customers. Similarly, if customers who have held credit cards for a shorter period of time tend to use cash advances more frequently, a business could focus on improving their cash advance services to retain these customers. Overall, analyzing clustering tenure can help businesses identify and target different customer segments based on their credit card usage behaviors, leading to improved customer retention and loyalty.

At this analysis we will try to cluster the tenure user using K-Means. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to group data points into distinct clusters based on their similarity. In this analysis, we will be applying K-means clustering to the credit card dataset to identify patterns and clusters of customers based on their credit card usage behaviors. One of the variables we will be focusing on is "Tenure" or the length of time a customer has held a credit card. We will examine the relationships between this variable and other credit card usage variables to see if there are any meaningful clusters of customers that can be identified.
